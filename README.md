GitHub Pages: Hosting Your Projects
GitHub Pages is a powerful feature offered by GitHub that allows you to host static websites directly from a GitHub repository. It provides an easy and free way to showcase your projects, personal website, documentation, or any other static content.

Setting Up GitHub Pages
Step 1: Create a Repository
To get started, create a new repository on GitHub. This repository will hold your website files. Make sure to name your repository appropriately, as the repository name will be part of your site's URL.

Step 2: Enable GitHub Pages
Once your repository is created, go to the repository settings. Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section. In the "Source" dropdown, select the branch you want to use for GitHub Pages, usually main or master. You can also select a specific folder if your site files are located in a subdirectory.

Step 3: Add Your Site Content
Add your HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and any other static files to your repository. These files will be served by GitHub Pages. You can create your site from scratch or use a static site generator like Jekyll, Hugo, or Gatsby to build your site.

Step 4: Push Your Changes
Commit and push your changes to the selected branch. GitHub Pages will automatically build and publish your site. Your site will be accessible at https://<username>.github.io/<repository>.

Customizing Your GitHub Pages Site
Custom Domain
You can use a custom domain for your GitHub Pages site. To set this up, go to the "GitHub Pages" section in your repository settings and add your custom domain. Then, configure your DNS settings to point to GitHub's servers.

Themes
GitHub Pages supports themes to quickly change the look and feel of your site. You can select a theme in the "GitHub Pages" section of your repository settings or by adding a _config.yml file with the theme configuration.

Jekyll
GitHub Pages natively supports Jekyll, a static site generator. By using Jekyll, you can create dynamic content with Markdown, Liquid templates, and plugins. To get started with Jekyll on GitHub Pages, add a _config.yml file and create your site structure.
